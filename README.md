# century-of-horror
A collection of data and some basic analysis and visualization about top box office ranked horror films from 1927-1999. Box office ranking data was gathered by hand from ultimatemovierankings.com and is therefore likely imperfect. Plot summaries were sourced from wikipedia for the purpose of topic modeling.
